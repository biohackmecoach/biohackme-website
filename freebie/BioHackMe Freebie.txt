These habits are the foundation of good health and can significantly impact your well-being without costing much.Intermittent Fasting: Consider intermittent fasting, which involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. It's not only cost-effective but can also offer numerous health benefits such as improved metabolic health, weight management, and cognitive function.Mindfulness and Meditation: Practice mindfulness and meditation to reduce stress, improve focus, and enhance overall mental well-being. There are plenty of free resources available online, including guided meditation videos and apps like Insight Timer and Headspace.DIY Biofeedback: Explore biofeedback techniques such as heart rate variability (HRV) training using smartphone apps or inexpensive HRV monitoring devices. These tools can help you manage stress and optimize your physiological responses without spending a lot.GUIDECold Exposure: Take advantage of cold exposure techniques like cold showers or ice baths, which can improve circulation, boost immune function, and increase resilience to stress. They cost nothing and can be easily incorporated into your daily routine.DIY Home Gym: Instead of splurging on a gym membership or expensive equipment, create a budget-friendly home gym with basic essentials like resistance bands, a jump rope, and adjustable dumbbells. You can find affordable options at thrift stores, online marketplaces, or even make your own equipment.Sunlight and Nature: Spend time outdoors and expose yourself to natural sunlight, which is crucial for vitamin D synthesis, mood regulation, and overall well-being. Nature walks, hiking, or simply sitting in a park can provide numerous health benefits at no cost.DIY Nootropics: Experiment with natural nootropics and cognitive enhancers such as caffeine, green tea, or adaptogenic herbs like Rhodiola Rosea and Ashwagandha. These substances can help enhance focus, memory, and cognitive function without breaking the bank.Community Support: Join online forums, social media groups, or local meetups focused on biohacking and health optimisation. You can learn from others' experiences, share insights, and discover cost-effective biohacking strategies that have worked for different people.Continuous Learning: Invest your time in educating yourself about biohacking principles, nutrition, and human physiology.
