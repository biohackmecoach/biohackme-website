    excerpt: 'For years, I\'ve watched the biggest names in biohacking gather in LA, Austin, Dallas, Singapore, Helsinki, London—everywhere but here. Until now. The Wanderlust Wellspring Summit brought Dave Asprey, Dr Will Cole, Wim Hof, and more to Australia\'s Gold Coast.',

In October 2025, something shifted. The Wanderlust Wellspring Summit landed on the Gold Coast, and with it came Dave Asprey, Dr Will Cole, Jeff Krasno, Dr Gabrielle Lyons, Wim Hof, Dr. David Sinclair, and a lineup of pioneers who've spent decades pushing the boundaries of human performance and longevity.

I wasn't just in the audience. I was on the stage.

And what I witnessed over those three days wasn't just a conference. It was a declaration: **Australia is ready for the next evolution of personalised health.**

But here's what nobody's talking about yet — and why it matters for you.

## Bio-Individuality: Why It Changes Everything

As one of the speakers, I've long advocated for a more data-driven, personalised approach to health optimisation.

Wellspring's core theme — bio-individuality — aligned perfectly with this message. For years, I've said: what works for one person may not work for another. It all comes back to testing, tracking, and tailoring interventions. This summit took that philosophy mainstream.

We've been sold one-size-fits-all protocols for decades — the same supplements, the same diets, the same "optimal" morning routines. Wellspring flipped that script entirely.

## Real-Time Data, Real Bodies

Wellspring stood out by offering visitors the opportunity to observe real-time testing and technology demonstrations:

* **Live blood analysis**
* **Liver ultrasounds** by The Liver Clinic (UK-based)
* **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy** and **IV drips** offered onsite
* **InBody Scans** - body composition analysis

Attendees also experienced **medical-grade red light therapy** from **Bon Charge** and were fuelled by **Chief Nutrition's** clean protein bars and **organic biltong** — a snack praised internationally for its nutrient density. We also got to try out the latest PEMF mat from **BestCellf** and Tallow skincare from **Tuttofare**.

## The Speakers: What They Said — and Why It Matters

### Kayla Barnes: The Human Experiment

Kayla Barnes tracks nearly every health metric imaginable — from nutrient levels to daily recovery scores. I found it fascinating and also overwhelming — and a useful reminder that even within biohacking, there's no single "right" approach. Only what aligns with your goals and your capacity.

Her testing protocols included:

* Micronutrient panels
* Total toxic burden screening (heavy metals, plastics, chemicals)
* Microplastics and nanoplastics exposure
* Gut microbiome sequencing (she uses Genova Diagnostics)
* AI-driven tools like Timeless Biotech for hormone mapping and Cleery AI for soft plaque detection
* Advanced imaging: GRAIL liquid biopsy, Prenuvo full-body MRI
* DEXA scans for body composition

Her precision-driven lifestyle sparked mixed reactions — some inspired, others overwhelmed. But her core message was clear: "you can't improve what you don't measure."

### Dr. Will Cole

Dr. Cole delivered a heartfelt session on the gut-brain axis. His approach blends science and soul — focusing on anti-inflammatory foods, emotional care, and being kind to your body.

His guidance? Avoid overly processed foods, support gut healing with simple stews and broths, and respect how your gut shapes your mental health.

### Dave Asprey

Having Dave Asprey at Wellspring was surreal.

He was brilliant, funny, irreverent — exactly what you'd expect. But one moment caught me off guard, it was emotional and joyful at the same time:

Seeing him hold my book — the one he endorsed — and getting his advice on navigating the backlash that comes with being first-to-market with my book in Australia's biohacking scene.

We talked about sceptics. Online bullies. The resistance that shows up when you're early in a movement.

His take? It's part of the process, they've all been through it, approach it with humour and humility.

That conversation reminded me why this work matters — and why I'm not slowing down.

### Olivia Arezzolo

Australia's top sleep expert broke down how chronotypes — your natural circadian rhythm — can transform recovery and energy.

She shared that "68% of individuals improve sleep patterns through tracking," and encouraged attendees to adopt supportive habits, not perfectionism.

### Wim Hof

Wim Hof stormed the stage — yelling "REVOLUTION!," doing splits, and radiating pure life force. His message? **Stress isn't the enemy.**

Cold exposure, breathwork, and challenge build resilience. His presence was a living example.

This was also discussed with the original founder of Wanderlust, Jeff Krasno who has written the book 'Good Stress' - he shared his own health journey and how to embrace hormesis into your life.

### Dr. David Sinclair: A Glimpse Into the Future

Dr. Sinclair outlined how global research is reshaping our understanding of ageing. He covered cellular reprogramming and NAD biology — topics still under investigation but loaded with promise.

His talk wasn't promotional. It was a scientific update — one that left many feeling cautiously optimistic.

## The Protocols: For Educational Purposes Only

The international speakers discussed interventions which are mostly currently in limited use abroad. These were not therapeutic recommendations, but educational insights into evolving fields:

* **Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE)**
* **EBOO (ozone therapy)**
* **Peptide protocols**
* **C8 MCT oil, exogenous ketones**
* **Cold exposure, fasting, light therapy**
* **Nicotine (as a researched nootropic)**

Many of these are not widely available or approved for use in Australia.

### Dr. Ross Walker

Dr. Walker has been a longtime advocate of preventative health in Australia. He spoke on genetics, including the **MTHFR gene**, and how understanding individual pathways can help guide more informed conversations with your healthcare provider.

He represented the vital bridge between mainstream medicine and emerging health trends.

## Sound, Movement, and Ritual

**Saint Haven** delivered a powerful sound healing experience in a chapel. Breathwork and yoga sessions were held throughout, led by some of Australia's finest facilitators.

The weekend closed with a cacao ceremony featuring **Loco Love** chocolate and a live set by **East Forest** — a sensory, soulful reminder that wellness includes the unseen and the felt.

## A Reality Check: Not Everything's Here — Yet

While the summit was energising, it also underscored a frustrating truth: **much of what we saw is still not accessible in Australia.**

From regulated therapies to unavailable diagnostics, the gap remains. But awareness is a step toward bridging it.

## Biohacking Must Be Accessible — Not Elitist

Here's my stance, and why I delivered a session on future proofing your health with the biohacking basics.

Biohacking cannot remain the domain of the wealthy, the well-connected, or those who can afford international clinics.

The power of this movement lies in scalability — small, evidence-backed practices that anyone can explore.

That's why I discuss biohacking stacking: layering simple, evidence-backed practices like:

* **Breathwork**
* **Sunlight exposure**
* **Cold therapy**
* **Whole-food nutrition**
* **Stress management**

The approach? Anchoring new habits to old ones. Building real routines. Starting with what's available to you now.

And above all, prioritising stress management — because chronic stress undermines everything else. Hormonal health. Cognitive clarity. Immune resilience.

Finding sustainable ways to down-regulate your nervous system. Whether through movement, nature, breathwork, or connection.

## Your Biohacking Roadmap (Education Only)

### 1. Test, Don't Guess

If accessible, start with simple data: micronutrients, hormone panels, DNA methylation. Always consult a qualified health professional before beginning any new testing.

### 2. Use Good Stress Wisely

Cold, movement, and fasting are known for building resilience — when done safely and with guidance.

### 3. Prioritise Detox Support

Support your body's natural detox pathways through lifestyle — hydration, nutrition, and rest.

### 4. Prioritise Recovery

Regeneration tools (like red light or quality sleep) are foundational, not fancy.

### 5. Build Community

You don't have to do this alone. Learning from others accelerates growth.

## What's Next?

**Get Your Baseline Data** Consider which assessments might be valuable for understanding your individual health status — such as DNA methylation testing, toxic burden screening, or micronutrient analysis. Discuss options with qualified healthcare practitioners.

**Start With What's Accessible** Explore foundational practices you can implement now: sleep optimisation, stress management techniques, movement, and whole-food nutrition.

**Join the Conversation** Connect with others interested in evidence-based approaches to health. Australia is part of the global conversation about personalised health. The question is how we engage with it thoughtfully and responsibly.

    title: 'Why I Take Fewer Supplements Than Ever (And You Might Want To As Well)',

Supplements played a key role in helping me reclaim my health after getting sick from mould exposure. I don't regret taking them—they supported my body when it was depleted and under serious stress. But here's the truth: they're not a long-term strategy.

I've come to believe that we shouldn't be taking supplements all the time. The body isn't built to be constantly stimulated or micromanaged. Like everything else in nature, it needs cycles—periods of support, followed by space to self-regulate and reset.

At one point, I was taking so many capsules and powders a day, it was overwhelming. My kitchen cupboards looked like a supplement aisle. Eventually, it became clear that what started as a healing tool had turned into a burden. I began questioning: Do I really need this? Is it helping—or just adding more noise to the system?

## The Supplement Industry Is Booming—But Not Always Safe

Some supplements can absolutely be beneficial—especially when used short-term or in response to specific deficiencies. Nutrients like magnesium, B12, vitamin D, iron, or omega-3s have strong clinical backing for certain conditions, and targeted supplements can help bridge gaps when dietary intake falls short.

One standout is creatine: well-researched, safe for most people, and backed by decades of studies for improving muscle strength, cognitive performance, and even cellular energy production. It's a great example of a supplement that works—when used appropriately. But they should be used wisely—not endlessly.

The global dietary supplement industry is worth more than US $230 billion, and is projected to surpass US $330 billion by 2030. That's a lot of capsules—and a lot of marketing dollars convincing us we need them.

But many products on the market are:

* Potentially toxic to vital organs like the liver and kidneys, especially with prolonged or high-dose use
* Low quality, using cheap fillers or synthetic forms
* Contaminated with heavy metals, especially in fish oil and plant-based powders
* Lacking in long-term safety data, especially newer formulations or high-dose stacks
* Poorly absorbed by the body, leading to expensive urine rather than real benefits

A recent reminder of this came with the news that Australian brand Blackmores is now facing a class action lawsuit after several consumers suffered neurological damage from vitamin B6 toxicity.

### The Long-Term Impact? We Just Don't Know Yet

Research is constantly evolving. Supplements once praised for mood support or stress relief—like Ashwagandha or 5-HTP—are now being re-evaluated. Some newer studies suggest that, for certain individuals, they may blunt emotional responses or dull both highs and lows over time.

One of the most overlooked concerns in the supplement world is this: we simply don't know the long-term impact of many of these compounds, especially when taken in high doses or combined in complex stacks. This is particularly true for cheaper brands, which may:

* Use synthetic or unstable forms of nutrients
* Skip essential testing for contaminants
* Contain undisclosed fillers, preservatives, or interactions

We're dealing with substances that haven't been around long enough—or studied deeply enough—to guarantee safety when used daily, year after year. Just because a supplement is on the shelf doesn't mean it's safe for chronic use.

And when something goes wrong, it's often chalked up to genetics or "mystery illness." But behind the scenes, your liver, kidneys, and gut are doing the hard work of filtering and processing every capsule. Without testing or professional oversight, the accumulated toxic load from subpar supplements can quietly erode your health.

## Food First, Supplements Second

Since that intense period of recovery, I've shifted my approach. I now follow a "less is more" philosophy, and I aim to meet my nutritional needs primarily through whole, high-quality food. Seasonal produce, wild fish, pastured meats, organ meats, fermented foods—these form the bedrock of my nutritional strategy.

That said, there are situations where supplements can be a game-changer—but only if they're targeted.

## My DNA Methylation Test Changed Everything

One tool that really helped me personalise my approach was DNA methylation testing. My results showed I have genetic variants that affect glutathione production (the body's master antioxidant) and vitamin B12 metabolism.

With that information in hand, I stopped guessing. I now supplement with:

* Liposomal glutathione, in liquid form for better absorption
* Methylated B12 (methylcobalamin), especially during stressful periods or when labs show a dip

## What I Look for in a Supplement

When I do take supplements, I'm selective. Here's what matters most:

### Third-Party Testing

I only buy from brands that publish Certificates of Analysis (COA), showing:

* No heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium)
* No microbial contaminants (mould, bacteria)
* Verified potency and active ingredient levels

### Clean, Bioavailable Forms

* Methylated B vitamins
* Chelated minerals like magnesium glycinate
* Triglyceride-form omega-3s, not ethyl esters
* Powders and liquids—easier to digest, minimal fillers

### Manufacturing Integrity

Look for:

* GMP-certified or TGA-listed brands
* Transparent sourcing
* No artificial flavours, colours, or preservatives

## What About IV Vitamin Infusions?

IV nutrient therapy is appealing: direct absorption, instant energy boost. I've done them a few times when I'm feeling run down or travelling and experienced immediate benefits from having them.

#### Pros:

* Immediate nutrient delivery, bypasses gut issues
* Useful for acute deficiencies or travel fatigue

#### Cons:

* Expensive (often $200–$500 per drip)
* Short-lived results if lifestyle isn't dialled in
* Risk of overdoing fat-soluble vitamins without regular bloodwork

I don't consider IVs a regular part of my wellness stack—but they can be a tool in the toolbox when needed and under supervision.

### Where to start?

* Start with good quality food—it's your foundation.
* Test before you supplement—DNA, micronutrients, gut health.
* Quality over quantity—always.
* Be cautious with trends. Just because a product is popular doesn't mean it's safe—or right for your biology.

Sometimes the most powerful biohack is knowing when to subtract, not add.

    keyTakeaways: [
      "The body needs cycles of support and rest, not constant supplementation",
      "Many supplements lack long-term safety data and may cause organ toxicity",
      "DNA methylation testing can help personalise your supplement approach",

    title: 'What Kind of Nutritionist Am I? Understanding the Path (and the Title) in Australia',
    author: 'Camilla Thompson',

    category: 'Professional Journey',
    excerpt: 'In Australia, "nutritionist" is not a protected title. That means anyone can technically call themselves a nutritionist—even without formal training. But there\'s a world of difference between someone who\'s read a few articles online and someone who has spent years studying.',

In Australia, "nutritionist" is not a protected title. That means anyone can technically call themselves a nutritionist—even without formal training. But there's a world of difference between someone who's read a few articles online or done a month course in nutrition to someone who has spent years studying and applying the science of nutrition in real-world settings.

## So, what kind of Nutritionist am I?

I'm a nationally recognised nutritionist, registered with Nutrition Council Australia. My qualification comes from a government-accredited course delivered through a Registered Training Organisation (RTO)—a rigorous, formal pathway that meets national standards. While I'm not a clinical nutritionist, dietician or RN, I am credentialed to assess nutritional needs and create evidence-based plans that support individual health goals.

Let me walk you through how I got here.

## My Journey into Nutrition

Twelve years ago, I began my education in health and nutrition through the Institute for Integrative Nutrition (IIN) in New York. It was a full year of intensive study in holistic health coaching and nutritional science. That foundational experience helped shape my understanding of the connections between food, behaviour, and long-term health.

Since then, I've spent the past nine years working as a health and wellbeing coach across Australia's corporate landscape—supporting high-performing professionals to optimise their energy, resilience, and lifestyle through science-backed strategies.

## Levelling Up: From Coaching to Nutritionist

Even with years of experience, I wanted to deepen my technical knowledge—specifically, to design and deliver tailored nutrition plans. A traditional degree wasn't viable given my commitments: running three businesses, writing a book, and coaching full-time.

That's when I discovered an alternative pathway: a nationally recognised course delivered through an RTO, approved by the government and supported by Skills Checkpoint—a program designed to help Australians over 45 retrain or upskill. I was initially sceptical, but after thorough due diligence, I confirmed the legitimacy and quality of the program. I secured a government grant and committed to a year of intensive study.

This wasn't a "tick-the-box" qualification. The curriculum covered nutritional biochemistry, dietary planning, supplement protocols, health assessment, and therapeutic diets—more nutrition education than most general medical degrees provide.

## So, What Does That Make Me?

Here's how I define my practice:

### Nationally Recognised, Evidence-Based

I hold a recognised credential that qualifies me to create individualised nutrition plans and provide guidance grounded in science.

### Not Clinical, But Deeply Trained

I don't diagnose or treat disease in a clinical setting, but I work closely with clients on diet, some supplementation, energy management, and performance optimisation.

### Coaching-Driven, Science-Informed

My coaching background means I don't just hand over a plan—I help people implement it. I use behavioural science, mindset work, and tracking tools to support lasting change.

### Real-Life Nutrition for Real People

Having built this path while managing multiple businesses, I get how chaotic life can be. The plans I create are practical, flexible, and designed for high-functioning, time-poor individuals.

Being a nutritionist in Australia comes with nuance. The title alone doesn't guarantee quality—but credentials, experience, and practical outcomes do. I've walked the path from health coach to formally trained, nationally recognised nutritionist—not just to add a title, but to better serve those looking to optimise their health in a meaningful, evidence-based way.

If you're looking for nutrition support that's personalised, informed, and grounded in the real world—not just theory—I'd love to help.

I was very lucky to have BrainTap at my recent book launch in Bondi Beach facilitated by the brilliant Dr Nicholas Keown, psychologist and integrative medicine doctor.

While BrainTap is already well-known in the US, it's only just starting to make waves here in Australia. And based on what I experienced, it won't stay under the radar for long.

So what exactly is BrainTap? And why are biohackers, high-performers, and wellness seekers raving about it?

## What Is BrainTap?

BrainTap is a wearable neurotechnology system that blends light and sound stimulation with guided audio to help you achieve deep mental states like calm, focus, creativity, and restful sleep. Think of it as meditation on fast-forward.

It consists of two core components:

* The BrainTap Headset: Equipped with LED lights and high-quality headphones, this device delivers synchronised pulses of light to your eyes and ears.
* The BrainTap Pro App: Offers over 700 audio sessions designed to target everything from stress reduction to enhanced focus, deep sleep, peak performance, and more.

Sessions typically last about 20 minutes, making them easy to fit into your day.

## How Does It Work?

BrainTap uses a combination of three scientifically validated technologies:

### 1. Brainwave Entrainment

By using binaural beats and isochronic tones, BrainTap helps guide your brain into specific states:

* Alpha: Relaxed and creative
* Theta: Meditative and intuitive
* Delta: Deep sleep and restoration

### 2. Light Therapy

Pulsed light from the visor and ear cups provides additional stimulation. This technique, known as Audio-Visual Brain Entrainment, helps reinforce the desired mental state more quickly and effectively.

One important note: BrainTap uses retinal flashing via LED lights, which is part of what makes the visual entrainment so effective. However, those with light sensitivity or a history of photosensitive epilepsy should use caution and consult a medical professional.

### 3. Guided Visualisation

Each session includes spoken guidance to support mental clarity, emotional regulation, or a specific cognitive goal. The combination enhances neuroplasticity and builds healthier mental patterns over time.

## What Does the Science Say?

BrainTap isn't just another wellness gadget—it's backed by clinical data:

* A study published in Global Advances in Health and Medicine found that a single BrainTap session improved stress markers by 38.5% and boosted neurological balance by 27.3%.
* Users also showed improved heart rate variability and enhanced parasympathetic tone, both markers of better stress resilience and nervous system health.
* Ongoing research with universities is exploring its benefits for sleep, memory, concussion recovery, and mood regulation.

## My Experience

I have a device at home and use it regularly. It really helps me to drop into a meditative state. The guided sessions keep me focused and grounded, especially when my mind is busy or distracted.

It's become a tool in my own wellness practice that helps me work smarter not harder when it comes to regulating my nervous system.

## Who's It For?

BrainTap is ideal for:

* Entrepreneurs and executives managing high stress
* Anyone struggling with sleep
* Creatives and professionals who want to boost mental clarity
* People looking to enhance meditation and mindfulness practices

If you have photosensitive epilepsy or other conditions triggered by light, consult your healthcare provider before trying BrainTap.

BrainTap is a next-gen wellness tool that combines science, tech, and accessibility. Whether you need a cognitive reset after a long day, a boost before a big presentation, or support for better sleep, it delivers practical results with minimal effort.

One of the things that most excites me about biohacking—right up there with saunas—is red light therapy. It's one of the most researched and fast-evolving therapies in the field, yet still flying under the radar when it comes to its deeper health applications.

While many people know it for its surface-level benefits—think glowing skin and post-gym recovery—what's unfolding right now is so much bigger. The latest research is pointing to red and near-infrared light therapy as a powerful, non-invasive tool for supporting gut health, calming inflammation, and even improving symptoms in conditions like Parkinson's disease.

This isn't fringe science. We're talking about clinical trials, microbiome mapping, and peer-reviewed studies that show measurable shifts—not just in how people feel, but in the very bacteria living in their gut.

And perhaps most exciting? A lot of this innovation is happening right here in Australia.

## One of the Most Researched Therapies of Its Kind

Red light therapy (also called photobiomodulation or PBM) has been studied for decades. In fact, it's now considered one of the most researched non-pharmaceutical, non-invasive therapies in the world.

Thousands of studies and dozens of meta-analyses have been published across areas including:

* Pain relief
* Muscle recovery
* Cognitive function
* Skin health
* Sleep quality
* Neurodegenerative and gastrointestinal conditions

A 2025 meta-analysis in BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies found significant improvements in weight, metabolic markers, and inflammation in people using red light therapy as part of obesity treatment. Another systematic review on age-related cognitive impairment found moderate improvements in global cognition, with results strongest in near-infrared protocols targeting the prefrontal cortex.

We're seeing the shift from beauty tool to legitimate medical modality.

## What the Australian Research is Showing

In Sydney, a five-year clinical study led by the University of Sydney and Sydney Adventist Hospital has been trialling red light therapy on people with Parkinson's disease. Participants received red and near-infrared light not just to the head, but also to the neck and abdomen—targeting the vagus nerve and gut-brain axis.

Results from the trial, published in BMC Neurology, included improvements in mobility, balance, cognition, sleep, mood, and even smell. What stood out even more were the microbiome changes: increased levels of Bacteroides and Prevotella, alongside reductions in inflammatory strains like Streptococcus. These shifts were sustained long term.

In Adelaide, another Australian team piloted a similar protocol. The SYMBYX study applied red light therapy to the abdomen and neck in Parkinson's patients and observed improved motor function, mood, and microbiome diversity. The findings were profiled by Parkinson's NSW, noting reduced inflammation and better gut-brain signalling after consistent therapy.

## Not All Red Light Devices Are Created Equal

Before you rush off to buy a red light panel online, here's something I've learned: the quality of the device matters—a lot. The market is flooded with cheap knock-offs, often manufactured with poor quality LEDs, weak irradiance, or incorrect wavelengths. A red light that simply looks red isn't necessarily doing anything for your cells.

To be effective, a red light therapy device must meet key criteria:

* Correct wavelengths: Primarily 660nm (red) and 850nm (near-infrared), which are the most clinically researched.
* Therapeutic irradiance: Output should be strong enough to deliver a measurable dose (often 60–100 mW/cm2 at the surface).
* Consistent beam spread: The arrangement of LEDs matters—scatter or low power density won't provide adequate coverage.
* Medical-grade standards: Preferably listed or registered with the TGA, FDA or equivalent authority.

Personally, I use Bon Charge red light panels because they're TGA approved—a huge tick for quality here in Australia. I know exactly what wavelengths I'm getting, how deep the light is penetrating, and that the technology has been independently tested. I won't use just anything on my body, especially something I'm applying to my brain or gut.

## The Gut-Brain Connection

We've known for a while that the gut and brain are deeply connected. What happens in the gut influences mood, cognition, immune function and even disease risk. But most therapies designed to support this axis rely on food, supplements, or medication. The idea that we can influence gut health using light might sound like science fiction—but the data is starting to catch up.

Red and near-infrared light stimulate mitochondria (the energy factories in our cells), helping them produce more ATP and reduce oxidative stress. When applied to areas like the neck or abdomen, light can improve blood flow, modulate vagus nerve activity, and reduce gut inflammation—creating an environment where beneficial bacteria thrive.

## Why It's One to Watch in 2025

Here's why I believe red light therapy is one of the most important biohacks to watch this year:

* It's non-invasive, drug-free, and safe

No needles, pills or downtime—just light, applied with precision.

* It's backed by high-quality research

Studies like those from Sydney, Adelaide, and recent meta-analyses confirm measurable results.

* It supports multiple systems at once

We're talking mitochondria, microbiome, mood, mobility, and cognition—all affected in one protocol.

* It's becoming more accessible

Thanks to high-quality at-home devices and increasing awareness, red light is no longer locked in elite clinics.

* It's still early days

We're just scratching the surface of what this therapy can do—and the next few years will be critical.

If you're bio-curious and looking for safe, effective ways to support your nervous system, gut health, energy or mood—red light therapy is absolutely worth your attention.

What I love most is that it aligns with everything we're learning about longevity: support the mitochondria, reduce inflammation, and rebalance the gut. The fact that we can do all this with something as simple as light still blows me away.

I would like to say this is new and emerging—but it's not. Methylene blue has been around for over a century, with a robust history in both clinical and research settings. Originally developed as a textile dye, it quickly gained medical significance for its antimalarial and antiseptic properties. What is new is the depth of research now going into its potential applications in brain health, mitochondrial support, and beyond.

In the wellness world, few compounds have stirred as much curiosity and controversy lately as methylene blue. Once confined to hospitals and laboratories, it's now making waves as a cognitive enhancer, mitochondrial support agent, and nootropic. But as interest grows, so does the pushback. So let's cut through the noise.

## What Is Methylene Blue?

Originally developed as a dye in the 19th century, methylene blue has a long-standing medical history. It was used to treat malaria during World War I and remains approved for treating methemoglobinemia, a rare blood disorder. It has also been employed in the management of urinary tract infections and as a surgical dye.

In Australia, methylene blue is registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for specific medical uses and appears on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). Products like PROVEBLUE 50 mg/10 mL injection are listed for medical use.

## What the Science Says

Methylene blue supports cellular energy by enhancing mitochondrial respiration and reducing oxidative stress. Researchers have been pioneering it as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease for over a decade, with clinical studies showing promise in slowing cognitive decline.

A 2016 study published in Neurotoxicity Research found that low doses of methylene blue improved memory retention in animal models. Additional studies have explored its broader potential in neurodegenerative diseases.

Harvard Health recently acknowledged the renewed interest in methylene blue, pointing out its historical applications and emerging potential in brain health and mitochondrial support.

A detailed review on ScienceDirect highlights its pharmacodynamics, antioxidant role, and research exploring its use in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. It also explains how methylene blue acts on the electron transport chain in mitochondria to enhance cellular respiration and energy production.

Additionally, GoodRx outlines that methylene blue is used to treat various conditions, including certain types of urinary tract infections and ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy (a rare neurological complication caused by the chemotherapy drug ifosfamide). It also notes precautions related to its interactions with SSRIs and other serotonergic drugs.

A recent comprehensive review in Frontiers in Pharmacology further reinforces methylene blue's role as a promising neurotherapeutic agent. The paper explores its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and mitochondrial-enhancing properties, particularly its potential in treating cognitive impairment and age-related neurological disorders.

That said, much of the current evidence remains preclinical. Human trials are limited. Importantly, dosage is key—higher doses can be toxic and can cause adverse effects.

## Safety and Drug Interactions

While methylene blue shows promise, it's not without potential risks. One key concern is its interaction with other medications—particularly antidepressants. Methylene blue is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), which means it can increase the levels of serotonin in the brain.

When combined with SSRIs, SNRIs, or other serotonergic drugs, it can significantly increase the risk of serotonin syndrome—a potentially life-threatening condition.

Symptoms can include agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, and high blood pressure. Anyone considering methylene blue should consult a healthcare professional, especially if they're taking psychiatric or cardiovascular medications.

## TGA and Regulatory Status

In Australia, methylene blue is registered with the TGA for specific medical uses but is not approved for general cognitive or wellness applications. It remains a Schedule 4 prescription-only medication. This underscores the need for informed, medically supervised use when exploring its potential beyond approved indications.

## My Approach: Informed, Not Alarmist

I'm often asked if I use methylene blue. My answer? Occasionally, and under guidance. I first tried it last year in Dallas at a biohacking conference and have used it a few times since—but it's not something I take regularly. I don't use it daily, nor do I suggest it as a miracle compound. But I also don't dismiss it outright just because it lacks wide-scale human trials. We need to hold space for nuance.

## Facts Over Fear

Dismissing methylene blue entirely because it hasn't passed through all regulatory hurdles misses the point. It has a documented safety profile when used properly, and real mechanisms of action that are biologically plausible. But jumping in blindly without understanding the dose, the interactions, or the context is equally unwise.

## Stay Curious, Stay Critical

Methylene blue isn't magic, but it isn't nonsense either. Like many emerging therapies, it's about balance: curiosity over cynicism, data over dogma, and always, personalisation over one-size-fits-all.

Imagine two people following the same healthy routine—similar diet, exercise, and sleep habits—but one thrives and the other struggles. The difference often comes down to personalisation.

Your health isn't a mystery—it just hasn't been personalised yet.

We've been conditioned to believe that health is complex, unpredictable, and largely out of our control. But what if the real issue is that we've been applying generic solutions to unique individuals?

## The One-Size-Fits-All Problem

Traditional health approaches treat everyone the same. Take 10,000 steps. Eat five servings of fruits and vegetables. Get eight hours of sleep. While these guidelines provide a starting point, they ignore the fundamental truth: we're all biochemically unique.

Your optimal sleep might be seven hours, not eight. Your body might thrive on higher protein and lower carbs. Your stress response might require different management strategies than your colleague's.

This is where personalised health comes in—and why it's revolutionising how we approach wellness.

## What Personalised Health Actually Means

Personalised health goes beyond generic recommendations to consider:

* **Genetic variations**: How your genes affect nutrient processing, detoxification, and metabolism
* **Microbiome composition**: The unique ecosystem of bacteria in your gut
* **Lifestyle factors**: Your stress levels, sleep patterns, and environmental exposures
* **Biomarkers**: Objective measurements of your health status
* **Personal history**: Your health journey, including past illnesses and treatments

## The Technology Making It Possible

Today's personalised health tools include:

**DNA Testing**: Companies like 23andMe and ApoE gene testing can reveal genetic predispositions and optimal dietary approaches.

**Continuous Glucose Monitors**: Originally for diabetics, these devices help anyone understand how different foods affect their blood sugar.

**Microbiome Testing**: Analysing gut bacteria to optimise digestion and immune function.

**Wearable Technology**: Devices that track sleep, heart rate variability, and activity levels provide personalised insights.

**Advanced Blood Testing**: Comprehensive panels that go beyond basic health markers to include nutrients, hormones, and inflammatory markers.

## Why Generic Health Advice Falls Short

Consider the Mediterranean diet—often called the "healthiest diet in the world." Research shows it's beneficial for many people, but not everyone thrives on it. Some individuals with certain genetic variants may struggle with the higher olive oil content, while others might not tolerate the grains.

The same applies to exercise. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is praised for its efficiency, but some people with certain stress responses might benefit more from gentle movement like walking or yoga.

## Making Personalisation Practical

You don't need expensive testing to start personalising your health approach:

**Track and Notice**: Keep a simple food and symptom diary. Notice patterns between what you eat, how you move, and how you feel.

**Experiment Systematically**: Try one change at a time for at least two weeks. This might be adjusting meal timing, trying a new form of exercise, or changing your sleep schedule.

**Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to energy levels, mood, digestion, and sleep quality as indicators of what's working.

**Work with Practitioners**: Consider working with a functional medicine doctor or qualified nutritionist who can help interpret testing and create personalised protocols.

## The Future of Health is Personal

As technology advances, personalised health will become even more sophisticated. We're moving toward a future where:

* AI algorithms will analyse multiple data points to provide real-time health recommendations
* Nutrigenomics will guide precise dietary interventions
* Personalised supplements will be formulated based on individual needs
* Exercise prescriptions will be tailored to genetic profiles and real-time recovery data

## Your Health Journey is Unique

Remember, what works for your friend, your favourite health influencer, or even your doctor might not work for you. Your health journey is unique, and your solutions should be too.

The goal isn't to find the "perfect" protocol but to develop a personalised approach that evolves with your changing needs, preferences, and life circumstances.

Your health isn't a mystery—it's a puzzle that can be solved with the right pieces. And those pieces are uniquely yours.

    category: 'Environmental Health',
    excerpt: 'Let\'s face it: most of us are unknowingly living in a toxic sh*t storm. From the moment we wake up to the moment we go to bed, we\'re exposed to countless chemicals that our great-grandparents never encountered.',

Let's face it: most of us are unknowingly living in a toxic sh*t storm.

From the moment we wake up to the moment we go to bed, we're exposed to countless chemicals that our great-grandparents never encountered. The problem isn't just one exposure—it's the compound effect of hundreds of small exposures adding up over time.

This isn't about fear-mongering or living in a bubble. It's about awareness and making informed choices that reduce your overall toxic load.

## The Modern Chemical Reality

Today's average person is exposed to over 700 chemicals daily. These come from:

* **Personal care products**: Shampoos, moisturisers, makeup, and deodorants
* **Household cleaners**: From toilet cleaners to air fresheners
* **Food packaging**: Plastics, non-stick coatings, and food additives
* **Indoor air**: Off-gassing from furniture, carpets, and electronics
* **Water supply**: Chlorine, fluoride, and pharmaceutical residues
* **Clothing**: Synthetic fabrics treated with chemicals for wrinkle-resistance and stain-proofing

The cumulative effect of these exposures is what researchers call your "chemical body burden"—the total load of chemicals stored in your tissues.

## Why Your Detox Pathways Are Overwhelmed

Your body has sophisticated systems for processing toxins—primarily your liver, kidneys, lungs, and skin. But these systems evolved to handle natural toxins, not the synthetic chemical cocktail of modern life.

When your detox pathways are overwhelmed:
* Toxins get stored in fat tissue
* Cellular function becomes impaired
* Inflammation increases
* Energy production decreases
* Hormonal balance is disrupted

## The Biggest Offenders in Your Daily Life

### Personal Care Products

Your skin absorbs up to 60% of what you put on it. Common culprits include:

* **Parabens**: Hormone disruptors found in many cosmetics
* **Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)**: Harsh detergent in shampoos and toothpaste
* **Phthalates**: Plasticisers in fragrances and nail polish
* **Formaldehyde-releasing preservatives**: Found in many mainstream products

**Simple Switch**: Choose products with fewer, recognisable ingredients. Look for brands that are transparent about their formulations.

### Household Cleaners

Many conventional cleaners contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that off-gas into your indoor air:

* **Ammonia**: Found in glass and surface cleaners
* **Chlorine bleach**: Creates toxic chloramine gas when mixed with other chemicals
* **Synthetic fragrances**: Often contain phthalates and other hormone disruptors

**Simple Switch**: Use simple ingredients like white vinegar, baking soda, and castile soap for most cleaning tasks.

### Food and Water

* **Pesticide residues**: Even after washing, fruits and vegetables retain chemical residues
* **Food packaging**: BPA and other plasticisers leach into food and drinks
* **Processed foods**: Contain preservatives, artificial colours, and flavour enhancers
* **Tap water**: May contain chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceutical residues, and heavy metals

**Simple Switch**: Choose organic when possible, especially for the "Dirty Dozen" fruits and vegetables. Filter your drinking water and reduce plastic food packaging.

### Indoor Air Quality

Indoor air is often more polluted than outdoor air:

* **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)**: From furniture, carpets, and paint
* **Formaldehyde**: Off-gassing from pressed wood furniture and finishes
* **Flame retardants**: Found in furniture and electronics

**Simple Switch**: Open windows regularly, add air-purifying plants, and choose low-VOC or natural materials when renovating.

## The Compound Effect: Small Changes, Big Impact

The good news? You don't need to overhaul your entire life overnight. Small, consistent changes create significant reductions in your toxic load:

### The 80/20 Approach

Focus on the 20% of changes that will give you 80% of the benefit:

1. **Switch your personal care basics**: Toothpaste, deodorant, and moisturiser
2. **Filter your water**: Both drinking and shower water if possible
3. **Choose organic for the "Dirty Dozen"**: The most pesticide-heavy fruits and vegetables
4. **Replace harsh cleaners**: With simple, natural alternatives
5. **Improve indoor air**: Open windows and add plants

### Read Labels Like Your Health Depends on It (Because It Does)

Look for:
* **Fewer ingredients**: Generally, shorter ingredient lists mean fewer synthetic chemicals
* **Recognisable ingredients**: If you can't pronounce it, your body might struggle to process it
* **Third-party certifications**: USDA Organic, EWG Verified, or Cradle to Cradle certified products

Avoid:
* **"Fragrance" or "Parfum"**: These terms can hide dozens of unlisted chemicals
* **Long lists of unpronounceable chemicals**: Especially in products you use daily
* **Products that require warning labels**: For obvious reasons

## Supporting Your Body's Natural Detox

While reducing exposure is crucial, you can also support your body's natural detoxification:

**Hydration**: Pure water helps your kidneys flush out toxins

**Fiber**: Helps bind toxins in your digestive system for elimination

**Movement**: Exercise supports lymphatic drainage and circulation

**Sauna**: Sweating eliminates toxins through your skin

**Sleep**: Your brain's glymphatic system clears toxins during quality sleep

## Making It Practical and Sustainable

Start small:
1. **Week 1**: Replace one personal care product with a cleaner alternative
2. **Week 2**: Switch to natural cleaning products for one room
3. **Week 3**: Add a water filter
4. **Week 4**: Choose organic for 2-3 foods you eat most often

The goal isn't perfection—it's progress. Every small change reduces your overall toxic load and supports your body's natural ability to heal and thrive.

Remember: you have more control over your chemical exposure than you might think. In a world where we can't avoid all toxins, we can certainly minimise them. Your body—and your energy levels—will thank you for it.

Anyone else feeling completely overwhelmed by health advice lately?

I know I am—and I work in this field.

We have access to more health information than any generation in history, yet we're more confused, more anxious about our health choices, and arguably sicker than ever. This is the paradox of wellness information overload.

## The Information Tsunami

Every day brings new studies, new "superfoods," new exercise protocols, and new supplements promising to optimise our health. Social media feeds are flooded with conflicting advice:

* One expert says carbs are evil, another says they're essential
* Morning workouts are best—no wait, evening workouts are superior
* Intermittent fasting is the key to longevity—but maybe not for women
* Supplements are necessary—actually, they're just expensive urine

It's exhausting.

## Why More Information Isn't Making Us Healthier

### Analysis Paralysis

When faced with too many options, our brains shut down. Instead of taking action, we continue researching, looking for the "perfect" solution. Meanwhile, we do nothing, and our health remains stagnant.

### The Perfectionism Trap

Social media presents polished versions of people's wellness routines. We see someone's morning routine that includes meditation, journaling, lemon water, supplements, yoga, and a workout—all before 8 AM. Instead of being inspired, we feel inadequate.

If we can't do it "perfectly," we often don't start at all.

### Information Without Context

A study showing benefits of a particular intervention gets amplified across social media without crucial context:
* Who was studied? (Often young, healthy males)
* What was the duration? (Many studies are short-term)
* What was the control group doing?
* What were the potential side effects or limitations?

Without this context, we make decisions based on incomplete information.

### The Conflicting Expert Problem

For every health claim, you can find an expert to support it and another to refute it. This isn't necessarily because anyone is lying—health research is complex, and individual responses vary significantly.

But this leaves us in a state of constant uncertainty.

## The Simple Truth About Health

Here's what decades of research consistently shows works for most people:

1. **Eat mostly whole foods**: Vegetables, fruits, quality proteins, healthy fats. The exact ratios can vary.
2. **Move your body regularly**: Find activities you enjoy and can sustain.
3. **Sleep 7-9 hours nightly**: Quality sleep impacts everything.
4. **Manage stress**: Find techniques that work for you and use them consistently.
5. **Connect with others**: Strong relationships are one of the biggest predictors of longevity.
6. **Avoid obviously harmful things**: Excessive alcohol, smoking, chronic stress.

That's it. Not sexy, not complicated, not requiring special supplements or equipment.

## How to Navigate the Wellness Information Storm

### Filter Your Sources

* **Choose 2-3 trusted sources**: Find experts who base their recommendations on research and acknowledge limitations
* **Unfollow accounts that make you feel inadequate**: Your mental health is more important than staying "informed"
* **Seek balance**: Be wary of anyone claiming their way is the only way

### Focus on Implementation, Not Information

* **The 1% rule**: Improve one small thing by 1% rather than trying to overhaul everything
* **Track what matters**: How do you feel? How's your energy? Your mood? Your sleep?
* **Give changes time**: Most interventions need 4-6 weeks to show effects

### Embrace "Good Enough"

Perfect is the enemy of good. A consistent "good enough" approach beats inconsistent perfectionism every time.

* 80% adherence to a simple plan beats 20% adherence to a complex one
* A 20-minute walk daily beats planning elaborate workouts you never do
* Simple whole food meals beat elaborate "superfood" recipes you make once

### Question the Latest Trend

Before jumping on the next wellness trend, ask:
* Is this sustainable for my lifestyle?
* Does this align with basic health principles?
* Am I considering this because it's new and exciting, or because it makes sense for me?
* What am I hoping this will fix that basics haven't addressed?

## The Power of Boring Consistency

The most powerful health interventions are often the most boring:

* Going to bed at the same time each night
* Eating vegetables with most meals
* Taking a walk after dinner
* Drinking water when you're thirsty
* Taking deep breaths when you're stressed

These aren't Instagram-worthy, but they're life-changing when done consistently.

## Making Peace with Health Uncertainty

Here's what I've learned: there will always be new information. There will always be conflicting advice. There will always be something new to worry about or optimise.

But your health journey doesn't need to be perfect to be effective.

Focus on the fundamentals. Trust your body's feedback. Make gradual improvements. And remember that the best health plan is the one you can actually follow.

Sometimes, the most radical thing you can do is ignore the latest health trend and stick to what you know works.

Your sanity—and your health—will thank you for it.

    excerpt: 'Biohacking is gaining traction in Australia. From red light therapy and wearable tech to longevity supplements and cold exposure, more people are exploring optimisation strategies beyond conventional wellness.',
    content: `
Biohacking is gaining traction in Australia. From red light therapy and wearable tech to longevity supplements and cold exposure, more people are exploring optimisation strategies beyond conventional wellness.

But media coverage of biohacking often swings between two extremes: breathless excitement about the "latest breakthrough" or dismissive scepticism about "dangerous trends."

Neither approach serves the public well.

## The Problem with Current Media Coverage

**Sensationalism Over Substance**: Headlines focus on extreme examples rather than practical applications. You're more likely to read about someone injecting experimental compounds than about the benefits of consistent sleep tracking.

**All-or-Nothing Narratives**: Biohacking is either presented as revolutionary or ridiculous, with little middle ground for nuanced discussion.

**Missing the Science**: Complex research gets oversimplified into soundbites, losing crucial context about study limitations, duration, and population studied.

**Expert Selection**: Media often features either extreme advocates or dismissive critics, missing experts who take balanced, evidence-based approaches.

## What Better Coverage Would Look Like

### Context Over Claims

Instead of: "New Study Shows X Supplement Increases Longevity!"
Try: "Preliminary research suggests X compound may benefit cellular health in animal studies. Human trials are needed to confirm effects and safety."

### Practical Application

Instead of focusing on extreme biohackers, highlight everyday applications:
* How sleep tracking can improve recovery
* Simple light therapy for seasonal affective disorder
* Practical cold exposure through cold showers
* Basic heart rate variability monitoring for stress management

### Risk-Benefit Analysis

Every intervention has trade-offs. Balanced coverage would address:
* Who might benefit most from this approach?
* What are the potential risks or contraindications?
* What does current research actually show vs. what's being claimed?
* How does cost compare to potential benefits?

## Questions Journalists Should Ask

**About Studies**:
* How many people were studied, and for how long?
* Who funded the research?
* Has this been replicated by independent researchers?
* Were there any conflicts of interest?

**About Interventions**:
* What are the potential side effects or risks?
* Who should avoid this approach?
* How does this compare to established treatments?
* What's the cost-benefit analysis?

**About Experts**:
* What are their qualifications and areas of expertise?
* Do they have financial interests in products they recommend?
* Do they acknowledge limitations and risks?
* How do their views compare to mainstream medical opinion?

## The Role of Responsible Experts

As someone working in this field, I have a responsibility to:

**Acknowledge Limitations**: Be clear about what research does and doesn't show. Preliminary findings aren't the same as proven interventions.

**Discuss Risks**: Every intervention carries potential risks. Responsible practitioners discuss both benefits and potential downsides.

**Avoid Overpromising**: Health is complex. No single intervention is a magic bullet.

**Recommend Professional Guidance**: Especially for more advanced interventions, working with qualified practitioners is essential.

## Moving the Conversation Forward

The goal shouldn't be to dismiss or uncritically promote biohacking, but to have more nuanced conversations that help people make informed decisions.

**For Media**: Seek experts who acknowledge both potential and limitations. Ask about risks alongside benefits. Provide context for research claims.

**For Practitioners**: Be transparent about uncertainty. Discuss both successes and failures. Collaborate with conventional medicine rather than positioning against it.

**For Consumers**: Seek multiple perspectives. Be sceptical of extraordinary claims. Consider working with qualified practitioners rather than self-experimenting.

## The Bigger Picture

Biohacking, at its best, represents a shift toward personalised, proactive health management. It encourages people to take ownership of their wellbeing and explore evidence-based optimisation strategies.

At its worst, it can promote unproven interventions, create unnecessary anxiety about health metrics, or lead to harmful experimentation.

The difference often comes down to how it's presented and practised.

We need media coverage that helps people navigate this complexity thoughtfully. Not every biohack is worth trying, but dismissing the entire field means missing genuinely helpful approaches to health optimisation.

The conversation should be about finding what works, what's safe, and what's worth the investment—not about whether biohacking is good or bad in absolute terms.

That's the kind of nuanced discussion that actually serves the public interest.
